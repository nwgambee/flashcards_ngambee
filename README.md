# FlashCards

## Abstract
This was our first project of Module 2. The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of Test Driven Development by implementing it into a flashcard-style game run through the command line. Test cases were written following Turing's TDD standards.

## Setup:
1 - To clone the repository, find and click on the `Clone or download` button on the top right corner of this page.

2 - Copy the SSH (or HTTPS if you use it) link and paste it into your terminal following the words `git clone`. The command should look this: `git clone git@github.com:nwgambee/flashcards_ngambee.git`

3 - `cd` into the parent directory of your local copy of the repo and run `node index.js` in your terminal.

4 - You are ready to play! Use the arrow keys and the space bar to run through the flashcards, and have fun!

Note: This game requires Node.js. If you do not have it installed and would like to learn how, follow the instructions [here](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)

Once all flashcards have been answered, a message will appear telling you what percentage you got correct and how long the round took you.
